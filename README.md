# Simple-Linear-regression-Model

This project demonstrates a simple linear regression model to predict an individual's height based on their weight. The model is built as part of my learning journey in machine learning and aims to explore foundational concepts like regression, data visualization, and model evaluation.

# Key Features
- Implemented a Simple Linear Regression model.
- Used Weight as the independent variable and Height as the dependent variable.
- Visualized the regression line and residuals to evaluate the model's performance.
- Calculated key metrics like R2 and RMSE to assess the model.

# Technologies Used
- Python: Programming language.
- Pandas: Data manipulation and analysis.
- Matplotlib/Seaborn: Data visualization.
- Scikit-Learn: Machine learning library for building and evaluating the regression model.

# Dataset
The dataset used for this project includes:
- Weight (in kg): The Weight of individuals.
- Height (in cm): The height corresponding to the weight.

# Future Scope
This project serves as a foundational model for regression analysis. Potential next steps include:
- Incorporating additional features like age and gender.
- Exploring non-linear relationships or polynomial regression.
- Using advanced machine learning models like decision trees or random forests.
